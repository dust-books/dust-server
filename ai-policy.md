# AI Policy

Use of AI tools will not bar you from contributing to Dust. It is important, however
that when you submit code to be merged into Dust, it's purpose and how it will be maintained
needs to be clear and understandable. For this reason, contributions to Dust follow a "0 Slop" policy.

I want to be clear though, that this is focused on preventing the contribution of "slop", which could
be generated by AI but also could be written by hand. It's also important to understand that it is unacceptable
to ask a member of the Dust team to review code that you have not reviewed yourself (either by writing it or
by reviewing the code that was generated for you). Ultimately, you should have a good understanding of how
your submission works before submitting it.

Lastly, we do use AI tools in the development of Dust. I've found that it does a particularly good job at
synthesizing documentation and other tasks that often get neglected. I have reviewed the content that was
generated for this purpose and aim to leverage "AI"-powered tools to keep it up to date, at least, until
the project finds someone passionate about maintaining documentation and would like that responsibility.
